#What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
*I was finding the interaction between GitHub and local repositories difficult. It wasn't really clear what the syntax of the `git push` and `git pull` and `git fetch` commands should say after the initial two words.

#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
*How to push changes up to the GitHub repository and making sure that we only push up changes from branches and that we need to input the branch name in the command.

#What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
*We discussed how to write out the `git push` command and how to fix an error when we pushed a change to the master and that we shouldn't be making changes to the master, only on branches.

#What still confuses you about Git?
*I'm still pretty confused about `git pull` but I'm starting to grasp it!

#How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
*I liked it! I was nervous at first but afterwards I found I understood the whole concept much better through having it explained a different way (versus reading about it or watching a video) and gaining hands-on experience to explaining it to another person. I also found that it made me slow down so I started to understand it more rather than just going through the motions.
